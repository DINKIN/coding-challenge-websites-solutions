# Coding Challenge Websites Solutions

My place to show my solutions, made mainly in Python, to various Coding Challenges Websites, all made with TDD in mind.

## Structure
In all cases the problem is stated inside the exercise folder in a file with the Problem_XX.rst and the solution is given in a file called Problem_XX_solution.py

**Do not open the solution file before codding by yourself, try several times, and try harder again, open the solution file only after this.**
