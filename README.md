My place to show my solutions, made mainly in Python, to various Coding Challenges Websites.

## Coding Challenge Websites

This is the websites that I'm used to go:

Name | Website
------------ | -------
Codewars | https://codewars.com
TopCoder | https://topcoder.com
Coderbyte | https://coderbyte.com
HackerRank | https://hackerrank.com
CodeChef | https://codechef.com
CodeEval | https://codeeval.com
LeetCode | https://leetcode.com
CodeCombat | https://codecombat.com
CodingGame | https://codingame.com


## Structure
In all cases the problem is stated inside the exercise folder in a file with the Problem_XX.rst and the solution is given in a file called Problem_XX_solution.py

**Do not open the solution file before codding by yourself, try several times, and try harder again, open the solution file only after this.**
