# Coding Challenge Websites Solutions

My place to show my solutions, made mainly in Python, to various Coding Challenges Websites.

## Coding Challenge Websites

This is the websites that I'm used to go:

Name | Website
------------ | -------
[Codewars] | https://andyet.com
TopCoder | https://www.topcoder.com
Coderbyte | https://coderbyte.com
HackerRank | https://www.hackerrank.com
CodeChef | https://www.codechef.com/
CodeEval | https://www.codeeval.com/
LeetCode | https://leetcode.com/


## Structure
In all cases the problem is stated inside the exercise folder in a file with the Problem_XX.rst and the solution is given in a file called Problem_XX_solution.py

**Do not open the solution file before codding by yourself, try several times, and try harder again, open the solution file only after this.**
